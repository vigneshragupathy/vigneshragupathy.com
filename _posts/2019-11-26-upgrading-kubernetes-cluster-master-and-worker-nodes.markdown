This post we are going to discuss how to upgrade the kubernetes cluster, both master and worker nodes. We are going to upgrade a older version v1.15 to v.1.16.

### **Setup**

I am using the Virtualbox(running in Ubuntu 18.04 physical machine) for this entire setup . The physical machine is Dell inspiron laptop with 12GB RAM , Intel® Core™ i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz × 4 and 512GB SSD hardisk.

### Master node

##### Step 1: Verify the current version of kubelet and kubeadm running in all nodes
{% highlight console %}

vikki@kubernetes1:~$ kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
kubernetes1 Ready master 41d v1.15.5
kubernetes2 Ready <none> 41d v1.15.5

{% endhighlight %}{% highlight console %}

vikki@kubernetes1:~$ kubeadm version
kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"15", GitVersion:"v1.15.5", GitCommit:"20c265fef0741dd71a66480e35bd69f18351daea", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2019-10-15T19:14:19Z", GoVersion:"go1.12.10", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

{% endhighlight %}

> We can see kubelet and kubeadm is running in version v1.15.5

##### Step 2: Verify the lastest stable availble version

Run the update in kubernetes master node

{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes1:~# apt update

{% endhighlight %}{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes1:~# apt-cache policy kubeadm
kubeadm:
    Installed: 1.15.5-00
    Candidate: 1.16.3-00
    Version table:
    .....

{% endhighlight %}

> We can see from this output that current version is 1.15.5 and the latest available is 1.16.3

##### Step 3: Upgrade the kubeadm to latest version

Upgrade the kubeadm in master to the latest version 1.16.3

{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes1:~# apt-mark unhold kubeadm && \
> apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.16.3-00 && \
> apt-mark hold kubeadm
kubeadm was already not hold.

After this operation, 4,062 kB of additional disk space will be used.

{% endhighlight %}
##### Step 4: Run the upgrade plan

Now in the previous step we already updated the kubeadm to latest version. Now lets run the upgrade plan and see the available options.

{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes1:~# sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
[upgrade/config] Making sure the configuration is correct:
[upgrade/config] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade/config] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.
[upgrade] Making sure the cluster is healthy:
[upgrade] Fetching available versions to upgrade to
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.15.5
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.16.3
[upgrade/versions] Latest stable version: v1.16.3
[upgrade/versions] Latest version in the v1.15 series: v1.15.6

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT CURRENT AVAILABLE
Kubelet 2 x v1.15.5 v1.15.6

Upgrade to the latest version in the v1.15 series:

COMPONENT CURRENT AVAILABLE
API Server v1.15.5 v1.15.6
Controller Manager v1.15.5 v1.15.6
Scheduler v1.15.5 v1.15.6
Kube Proxy v1.15.5 v1.15.6
CoreDNS 1.3.1 1.6.2
Etcd 3.3.10 3.3.10

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

    kubeadm upgrade apply v1.15.6

_____________________________________________________________________

{% endhighlight %}

> We can see that we can upgrade the cluster to v1.16.3 from the above output

##### Step 5: Drain the pods in master node

Now drain all the pods execpt daemonsets in the master node

{% highlight console %}

vikki@kubernetes1:~$ kubectl drain kubernetes1 --ignore-daemonsets

{% endhighlight %}
##### Step 6: Run the upgrade

Now run the upgrade to the lastest version 1.16.3

{% highlight console %}

[upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to "v1.16.3". Enjoy!

[upgrade/kubelet] Now that your control plane is upgraded, please proceed with upgrading your kubelets if you haven't already done so.

{% endhighlight %}

> We can see the cluster is upgraded to lastest version v1.16.3

##### Step 7: Uncordon the master node

Now ucordon the master node

{% highlight console %}

vikki@kubernetes1:~$ kubectl uncordon kubernetes1 
node/kubernetes1 uncordoned

{% endhighlight %}
##### Step 8: Upgrade the kubelet 

Now in the previous steps we have upgraded the kubeadm and cluster , next we need to upgrade the kubelet and kubectl

{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes1:~# apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
> apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet=1.16.3-00 kubectl=1.16.3-00 && \

##### Step 3: Upgrade the worker node
{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes2:~# sudo kubeadm upgrade node
[upgrade] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -oyaml'
[upgrade] Skipping phase. Not a control plane node[kubelet-start] Downloading configuration for the kubelet from the "kubelet-config-1.16" ConfigMap in the kube-system namespace
[kubelet-start] Writing kubelet configuration to file "/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml"
[upgrade] The configuration for this node was successfully updated!
[upgrade] Now you should go ahead and upgrade the kubelet package using your package manager.

{% endhighlight %}
##### Step 4: Upgrade the kubelet and kubectl

In previous steps we upgraded the kubeadm and cluster. Now we need to upgrade the kubelet and kubectl.

{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes2:~# apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && \
> apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet=1.16.3-00 kubectl=1.16.3-00 && \
> apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl
kubelet was already not hold.
kubectl was already not hold.

{% endhighlight %}

Restart the kubelet service in worker node

{% highlight console %}

root@kubernetes2:~# sudo systemctl restart kubelet

{% endhighlight %}
##### Step 5: Uncordon the worker node

Now uncordon all the pods in kubernetes2 worker onde

{% highlight console %}

vikki@kubernetes1:~$ kubectl uncordon kubernetes2
node/kubernetes2 uncordoned

{% endhighlight %}{% highlight console %}

vikki@kubernetes1:~$ kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
kubernetes1 Ready master 41d v1.16.3
kubernetes2 Ready <none> 41d v1.16.3

{% endhighlight %}

> We can see now both the master and worker nodes are upgraded from v1.15.5 to v1.16.3
