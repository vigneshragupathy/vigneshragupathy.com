## Summary

My role in SBI is technical, and it involves consulting, design, Architecture and reviewing of application and infrastructure.

## Why leaving job from State Bank of India

The decision for leaving the job at state bank of India is both personal and family. Some of the key points that influence the decisions are no WFH, no relocation/transfer of job, micro management, unnecessary and complicated process, poor decision making and low learning curve/Legacy technologies. 

One of the important factor that any organisation should focus is equally changing the organisation culture when they modernise the technology stack. There are significant effort put on hiring technical experts, digital transformation, cloud strategy but very little on organisation culture.

## To SBI (on request from SBI colleagues)

-  Invest as equally as technology transformation in cultural transformation.
-  Let the internal team solve the hard problems and use the external teams /vendors only to enable the in-house teams
-  IT operations need engineers, not just the people managers. Replace people managers with engineering managers whereever needed. Do not mix them both. 
-  Make an open/transparent and employee friendly organisation.

## So whats next ?

So what am I doing next? It's been a privilege and an adventure to work in SBI as Infrastructure Architect with so many amazing people. But I'm now excited about my new role as Sr Site Reliability Engineer at Sage Intacct, Bangalore.
