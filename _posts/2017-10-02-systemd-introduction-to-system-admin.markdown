### what is systemd:

systemd is a service manager/init process used to bootstrap the userspace and manage all process.  
Already systemd is the default init system for many operating systems including redhat, ubuntu, fedora and many others. Systemd is useful for a system administrator, as it provides many features to manage the OS efficiently.

### Why systemd:

Here are the few reasons why systemd is needed.  
Note: Some of the reasons below are disagreed by the developers and traditional SysV users

Speedup the boot by increasing the concurrency of process startup  
Better process management – by babysitting process  
Better dependencies management of process during startup  
Reduce computational overhead of shell script used during boot

### Systemd components:

How systemd increases concurrency of process start

In Linux, services can be provided by INET socket or D-bus.

### For INET socket:

Each process has dependencies. Example NFS mounts daemon waits for RPC bind.sock and portmapper IP port.  
Similarly, each daemon has its own dependencies and it may have to wait for the socket opening. Further, each daemon may have other daemon dependencies, this will further increase the wait time.

So the idea of the systemd is to start the sockets before the daemon start. Although socket has no much dependencies, we can create all the sockets for all daemon at one step. If all sockets are created then we can start all the daemons at the same time currently.

There may be wait time if a daemon needs another daemon dependency the daemon is not started, But that’s ok according to systemd.  
We still reduce the wait time of socket creation. By doing this we achieve following things

Boot time reduced  
Dependencies between service no longer exist  
Startup is parallelized  
For D bus

D-bus can also be activated using the same logic of traditional INET socket.  
Instead of starting the service at startup, we can start the first time it is accessed using bus activation.  
It also provides options for starting up provider and consumer at the same time.

### Filesystem

During system boot, there are lots of time spent waiting for filesystem jobs example: mounting, fsck, quota, quotoACL etc.  
Only after this, the kernel will start the actual services. To reduce this time spent, systemd will setup an autofs mount and start the service.  
when the filesystem finishes the quota etc it will replace by the real mount. This cannot be done for the filesystem like /,/proc where the service binaries are stored.

### How daemon escapes init by double forking

Double forking is meant to make a process orphan and making it as a child for init process(PID 1). By this way, we can daemonize a process.  
By double forking a process, it’s difficult to identify how the process is originally spawned in SysV. But systemd uses the Cgroups to keep track of the process.  
For full application servers like apache which usually spawn many child processes, it is difficult to kill the entire service. Killing the apache process sometimes will not kill all its child process.Here systemd comes to rescue which uses systemctl to easily kill all process of a service.

{% highlight console %}

vikki@trinity:~$ systemctl kill httpd.service

{% endhighlight %}

Cgroups also keeps track of cpu/mem utilzation of each process. To see Cgroups cpu/memory details

{% highlight console %}

vikki@trinity:~$ systemd-cgtop
Control Group Tasks %CPU Memory Input/s Output/s
/ – 12.6 3.4G – –
/init.scope 1 – – – –
/system.slice 43 – – – –
/user.slice 546 – – – –
/user.slice/user-1000.slice 546 – – – –

{% endhighlight %}

To recursively see Cgroups contents

{% highlight console %}

vikki@trinity:~$ systemd-cgls

To see the time spent in system startup

{% highlight console %}

vikki@trinity:~$/usr/lib/systemd/network$ systemd-analyze time
Startup finished in 6.503s (kernel) + 11.296s (userspace) = 17.799s
