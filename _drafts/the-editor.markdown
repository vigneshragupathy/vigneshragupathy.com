Ghost has a powerful visual editor with familiar formatting options, as well as the ability to seamlessly add dynamic content.

Select the text to add formatting, headers or create links, or use Markdown shortcuts to do the work for you - if that's your thing.

## Rich editing at your fingertips

The editor can also handle rich media objects, called **cards**.

You can insert a card either by clicking the &nbsp;`+` &nbsp;button on a new line, or typing &nbsp;`/` &nbsp;on a new line to search for a particular card. This allows you to efficiently insert **images** , **markdown** , **html** and **embeds**.

**For Example** :

- Insert a video from YouTube directly into your content by pasting the URL 
- Create unique content like a button or content opt-in using the HTML card
- Need to share some code? Embed code blocks directly 
<!--kg-card-begin: code-->

    <header class="site-header outer">
        <div class="inner">
            {{> "site-nav"}}
        </div>
    </header>

# Working with images in posts

You can add images to your posts in many ways:

- Upload from your computer
- Click and drag an image into the browser
- Paste directly into the editor from your clipboard
- Insert using a URL

Once inserted you can blend images beautifully into your content at different sizes and add captions wherever needed.
