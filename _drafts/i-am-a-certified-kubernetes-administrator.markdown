title: I am a Certified Kubernetes Administrator
---

Before writing the exam for linux foundation, i have some good experience in various other exams.You can see list of my certificaiton in my Linkedin page www.linkedin.com/in/vignesh88. Considering my experiense in hands on exams , i was very optimistic about . I &nbsp;will be comparing my experince about Redhat exam and Linux fondation exams also with the details for how to prepare yourself before writing for this exam. I am a big fan of redhat exams, I am very proud that i have cleared 7 levels of exams in redhat , all in a single attempt with not more than 3 days of preparation, including most revered performance turning exam ( though i have very good experience in Linux)

I am going to share some stuffs i used assuming that will be helpfull for others going to take the CKA exam.

I don't like the idea of considering certifcation being "not current". This is the marketting technique that many organisation do to make the person retake the exam. Do you agree if the university annouce your degree not current after few years of graudation, May be not. But when you do a certificaiton , you have to keep retaking the exam every 3 years or less to have it current. I almost spent 2.5Lakhs Ruppes(not a company sponsered) for completing the RHCA certificaiton from redhat , but after 3 years it is going to be not current.
