<p>I have been trying my hand in photography for a few months now. Recently during a trip to Bannerghatta National Park i managed to shoot some of the wildlife using my DSLR camera. Here are few snaps from my recent trip to Bannerghatta National Park.</p>

<p>The tiger’s tongue is covered with numerous small, sharp, rear-facing projections called papillae. These papillae gives the tongue is rough, rasping texture and is designed to help strip the skin, feathers, fur and meat right off its prey</p>

<p>Lions enjoy relaxing and lazing around. They spend between 16 and 20 hours each day resting and sleeping. They have few sweat glands so they wisely tend to conserve their energy by resting during the day and become more active at night when it is cooler.</p>

<h3 id="all-subspecies-of-tiger-have-white-spots-or-flashes-on-the-backs-of-their-ears">All subspecies of tiger have white spots or ‘flashes’ on the backs of their ears.</h3>

<p>It is more likely that ear spots are a signal of aggression. A tiger under threat will rotate the ears in such a way that the spots can be seen from the front so providing a visual warning</p>

<h3 id="all-cats-walk-on-their-toes">All cats walk on their toes.</h3>

<p>During a walk the tiger lifts both limbs on the same side together. This gait is similar to that of a camel, and quite unlike that of a horse.Some people claim the tiger has almost mathematically precise movement with the hind paw stepping in exactly the spot previously occupied by the forefoot.</p>

<h3 id="a-tigers-eyes-are-the-brightest-of-any-animal">A tiger’s eyes are the brightest of any animal.</h3>

<p>Tigers have eyes with round pupils, unlike domestic cats, which have slitted pupils. This is because domestic cats are nocturnal whereas tigers are crepuscular – they hunt primarily in the morning and evening.</p>
